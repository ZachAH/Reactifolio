                My name is Zach Howell I am currently enrolled in the UW Extended Campus Bootcamp. After i succesfully finish the course i will be a certified Full Stack Developer!!! I love music i curently play two instruments. The Drums and the Guitar. From what i have found coding is a lot like that learning new langauges every week is definatley tough but a lot like learning new songs or techniques on musical instruments. I will continue to increase my knowledge of programming langauges far beyond the course,(and definately get better at react ðŸ˜œ).
